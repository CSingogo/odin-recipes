    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook Noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Brown Meat: In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and cook until the meat is browned and the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Prepare Sauce: Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), basil, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper to the meat mixture. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare Cheese Mixture: In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, and half of the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Layering: In a baking dish, start assembling the lasagna. Begin with a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of noodles, and then a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cheese Topping: Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. Then, uncover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let it Rest: Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
        <li>Serve: Slice the lasagna into portions and serve with a sprinkle of fresh parsley on top. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
